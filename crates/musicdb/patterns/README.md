# ImHex Patterns

- [`mac-time.hexpat`](./mac-time.hexpat): [custom data inspector row](https://docs.werwolv.net/imhex/views/data-inspector#adding-new-rows) for viewing macOS timestamps
- [`compressed.hexpat`](./compressed.hexpat): the compressed file format; only relevant data is the header
- [`decompressed.hexpat`](./decompressed.hexpat): uncompressed file format. note that processing can take some time for larger inputs; you can enable / disable the parsing of certain structs conditionally through the options
