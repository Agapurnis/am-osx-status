# musicdb

Parser for Apple's proprietary "musicdb" format.

Currently only supports `Library.musicdb` files.

## Special Thanks

This wouldn't have been possible without the work of [Gary Vollink](https://www.home.vollink.com/gary/),
who [documented what he found when analyzing his own files](https://home.vollink.com/gary/playlister/musicdb.html).

I would've had neither the expertise nor motivation to attempt to undertake this if it weren't for his efforts.

## Format

Several [ImHex](https://imhex.werwolv.net/) patterns can be found [in the `patterns` directory](./patterns/).
