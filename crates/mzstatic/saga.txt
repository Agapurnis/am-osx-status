tried with 000003 => "com.apple.itunes.asset.repository.core.InvalidTokenException: Invalid token: SG-S3-US-Std-Image-000003/v4/af/f2/c9/aff2c94c-ccb5-1187-a744-e61926415d00/image"

ok that shit is abandoned now and i dont know what shit they are doing on the inside to make it work
so i'm done with this







Now that I think about it, the "accelerator directives" definitely have to do with what these are doing.
The three numbers, and a region. Wasn't really sure before, but it seems really likely now.
